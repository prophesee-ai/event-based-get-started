5. COMPENSATION TO THE METAVISION® SDK PRO LICENSE
==================================================

5.1. Invoicing. In consideration of and as a full and final compensation to the (i) the License granted by PROPHESEE to METAVISION® SDK PRO, and (ii) the deliveries of METAVISION® and the services performed by PROPHESEE and (iii) the sublicensing rights granted by PROPHESEE to LICENSEE pursuant of 2.1.(d)above, LICENSEE agrees to pay respectively to PROPHESEE the upfront License Fee and the Royalty Fee or Substitution Fee whose amounts are detailed in the Quotation and following the process and conditions detailed in Sections 5.2 to 5.3 below.

5.2 License Fee. In consideration and as full and final compensation of the Developers access right granted to METAVISION® number of copies set forth in the License Agreement, the License and the services provided by PROPHESEE, LICENSEE agrees to pay PROPHESEE: an access right lump sum upfront amount whose amount is detailed in the Quotation ("License Fee”). This License Fee is neither refundable, cancellable nor transferable even if LICENSEE decides to exert none of the licensing rights granted herein.

5.3. Royalty Fee. In consideration of the sub-license granted by PROPHESEE to the LICENSEE pursuant to Section 2.1. (d) above, the per unit royalties fees ("Royalty Fee”) whose amount is detailed in the Quotation for any and each unit of Device sold by the LICENSEE to End-Users and each Device sold by End-Users, being understood and agreed by the Parties that if at least one Device is commercially sold by LICENSEE and/or any End-Users as embedding a part of the Device Software, then the Royalty Fee is due for each unit of Device.

5.3.1. Subject to Section 2.1 provisions and before any part of the Device Software is integrated into a new Device and/or licensing rights are granted to an End-User on a part of the Device Software, LICENSEE shall provide PROPHESEE with written notification defining (a) the date of first Device Software shipment and the Device Software access rights granted from LICENSEE to End-Users; and (b) the name and location of the End-User; and (c) information allowing to identify and track such Device and Device Software type, such as e.g. description of a camera imaging processing chip, geographical areas where such Device type will be commercially available.

5.3.2. During the production period of Devices, within fifteen (15) days after the end of each quarter, LICENSEE will provide PROPHESEE with a sales report stating the number of units of Devices shipped to End-Users and the number of Device Software licensed to End-Users as well as the number of units of Devices sold by End-Users during the preceding quarter.

Once PROPHESEE has received and checked the reported information, PROPHESEE will issue an invoice to charge LICENSEE the Royalty Fee for the units reported for such quarter based on the agreed Royalty Fee per unit as set in the Quotation, computed and aggregated from the Effective Date. The fact PROPHESEE issues an invoice based on LICENSEE’s units report shall not operate to void any right for PROPHESEE to conduct any further audit for such period as expressed in Section 5.6 below.

Should LICENSEE fail to provide PROPHESEE with such report in due time, PROPHESEE shall charge LICENSEE a provisional amount corresponding to the highest previous reported quarter. Should LICENSEE fail to provide PROPHESEE with two (2) or more successive reports in due time, a penalty corresponding to the late payment induced by the late reporting according to Section 5.4 rules, shall apply on the amount to be paid by LICENSEE at such contractual due date of payment, which computing rules are detailed in Section 5.4 below.

5.3.3. In case the LICENSEE is not capable for technical or legal reasons to provide PROPHESEE with the number of Devices shipped and/or the number of Device Software licensed to End-Users as well as the number of units of Devices sold by End-Users, LICENSEE shall detail its incapacity in the notification to be served to PROPHESEE pursuant to Section 5.3.1 above. Upon receipt of such notification and prior to any commercialization of the Device or Device Software by LICENSEE, the Parties will discuss in good faith and agree with a special compensation to the sublicensing rights to be granted by PROPHESEE to LICENSEE in accordance with Section 2.1.(d) that will substitute and, in any cases, result in a higher amount as the Royalty Fee (the "Substitution Fee”). For the sake of clarity, the sublicensing rights to be granted pursuant to Section 2.1.(d) are subject always to: (i) such agreement between the Parties on the Substitution Fee; and (ii) complete and full payment of the Substitution Fee by LICENSEE to PROPHESEE once agreed.

5.4. Payment terms. LICENSEE shall make all payments required hereunder net and free of any deduction, withholding, or other bank fees and charges. No payment by any other person than the LICENSEE is authorized. PROPHESEE reserves the right to send the payment back to the payer in case of any payment made by a third party and to charge bank transfer fees resulting from such transaction to the LICENSEE, without prejudice to further claim or indemnification PROPHESEE could claim for bad or late payment.

Each payment hereunder shall be made by LICENSEE to PROPHESEE by wire transfer within thirty (30) days of LICENSEE’s receipt of an invoice; therefore, it is agreed by the Parties that the date of an invoice sent in pdf file format attached to an electronic mail is considered as the date of such receipt. Should LICENSEE fail to provide PROPHESEE with its quarter reports in due time, LICENSEE payment terms will be reduced accordingly to avoid delaying the actual date of payment to PROPHESEE which would otherwise have been applicable.

All amounts payable by LICENSEE under this Agreement shall be paid in Euros, US Dollars or in RMB, in accordance with the currency as set forth in the License Agreement, net of all fees (including but not limited to any bank, transfer and exchanges fees).

A fixed compensation amount of forty euros (40€) for recovery costs shall automatically be due, without prior notice, by the LICENSEE for any invoiced amount not fully paid by its due date, in accordance with the articles L.441-6 and D.441-5 of the French Commercial Code. In addition, PROPHESEE shall be entitled to claim additional compensation if the recovery costs exceed such fixed compensation amount. On top of these recovery costs, LICENSEE shall pay interest to PROPHESEE on the aggregate amount of any payments that are not paid on or before the date such payments are due under a License Agreement, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applied by the European Central Bank in its latest refinancing operation plus ten per cent (10%) from the due date of such payment, or the highest rate permitted by applicable law, calculated on the number of days such payments are paid after the date such payments are due. In the event of failure to make payment when due under the License Agreement, PROPHESEE shall be entitled, without prejudice to its other rights and remedies, to terminate the License Agreement with neither liability nor compensation due to the LICENSEE.

5.5. Taxes. All customs and excise duties, import and/or export duties and other taxes, tariffs and surcharges of any nature whatsoever now or hereafter levied or imposed in any country or territory, either directly or indirectly, in respect of the License and supply of Support Services shall be borne by the LICENSEE and are payable in addition to the compensation as above.

5.6. Verification of quantities. LICENSEE will keep for a period of at least four (4) years all records needed to count, compute, review and verify the Royalty Fee or the Substitution Fee due to PROPHESEE under this Agreement.

Upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to LICENSEE, and no more frequently than once in any twelve (12) month period, PROPHESEE shall have the right, at its own costs and expenses, to appoint a mutually agreeable, independent and internationally recognized firm (the "Auditor”) to audit, upon prior appointment between the Parties during normal business hours of LICENSEE, whatever LICENSEE’s records the auditor might require to verify the calculation of the Royalty Fee or Substitution Fee due to PROPHESEE under this Agreement.

Should any such audit reveal that LICENSEE provided PROPHESEE with inaccurate information regarding licenses granted on the Device Software and/or Device sales quantities resulting in an underpayment of the Royalty Fee or Substitution Fee owed for the period covered by such audit, LICENSEE shall immediately pay to PROPHESEE the amount of such underpayment along with a late payment penalty the computing rules of which are detailed in second paragraph of Section 5.4 here above.

In addition, should any such audit reveal an aggregate underpayment of the Royalty Fee or Substitution Fee owed by LICENSEE for the period covered by such audit, LICENSEE shall reimburse PROPHESEE for the fees actually paid by PROPHESEE to the Auditor for such audit.
